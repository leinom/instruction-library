# Agent Coding Instructions & Philosophy

## I. Core Philosophy

* **Clarity and Readability**: Code should be as self-documenting as possible. Strive for simplicity and explicitness.
    * *Rationale*: Understandable code is easier to maintain, debug, and extend.
* **Safety and Robustness**: Prioritize writing code that prevents errors, handles them gracefully, and behaves predictably.
    * *Rationale*: Minimizes bugs, security vulnerabilities, and unexpected crashes.
* **Performance by Design**: Aim for efficient algorithms and data structures. Understand the performance implications of language features and libraries.
    * *Rationale*: Ensures applications are responsive and scalable.
* **Developer Experience (DX)**: Strive for a development environment and codebase that are enjoyable and productive to work with. This includes clear guidelines, good tooling, and fast feedback loops.
    * *Rationale*: Happy and productive developers write better code.
* **Pragmatism over Dogmatism**: While these guidelines provide a strong direction, understand when specific project constraints or language idioms necessitate deviations. Always have a good reason.
    * *Rationale*: Avoids applying rules blindly where they might be counterproductive.
* **Control and Predictability**: Write code whose behavior is easy to reason about and predict. Minimize side effects.
    * *Rationale*: Simplifies debugging and understanding system state.
* **Zero-Cost Abstractions (where applicable)**: Favor abstractions that do not introduce runtime overhead if not used, or where the overhead is negligible and justified by the gain in clarity or safety.
    * *Rationale*: Enables high-level programming without sacrificing performance, crucial in systems programming but beneficial generally.
* **Flexibility and Maintainability**: Design code that is easy to change, adapt, and extend over time.
    * *Rationale*: Software evolves, and adaptable code reduces the cost of future changes.

## II. Coding Principles & Style

### A. Code Readability & Structure

1.  **Naming Conventions**:
    * Use clear, descriptive, and consistent names for variables, functions, classes, modules, etc.
    * Follow language-specific idiomatic naming conventions (e.g., `camelCase`, `PascalCase`, `snake_case`). 
2.  **Modularity and Encapsulation**:
    * Prefer repeting code over abstractions. 
    * Optimization is evil. 
    * Use language-specific mechanisms for visibility control (e.g., `private`/`public` keywords, module export systems, naming conventions like a *single leading underscore* for "internal use" where idiomatic).
3.  **Function Design**:
    * Aim for pure functions where possible:
        * Their output depends only on their input arguments.
        * They have no side effects (e.g., modifying external state, I/O).
    * Limit the number of function parameters. Consider using objects or structs for functions with many parameters.
4.  **Code Formatting**:
    * Adhere to a consistent code style. Use automated formatters (e.g., Prettier, Black, gofmt) whenever possible.
    * *Rationale*: Consistent formatting improves readability and reduces cognitive load.

### B. State Management & Immutability

1.  **Favor Immutability**:
    * Treat data as immutable by default. Avoid in-place modification of data structures.
    * Use language features that enforce immutability (e.g., `final` in Java, `const` in JavaScript/C++, immutable data types).
    * *Rationale*: Simplifies reasoning about state, reduces side effects, and improves thread safety.
2.  **State Management**:
    * If mutable state is necessary, isolate it and manage it carefully.
    * Lift state to the highest appropriate level in the component/application hierarchy.
    * Avoid mutating state at the lowest levels or passing mutable objects down deeply.
    * Clearly document and justify any use of mutable state.

### C. Control Flow & Data Processing

1.  **Expressive Control Flow**:
    * Prefer declarative approaches over imperative ones where it enhances clarity.
    * Utilize iterators, generators, streams, and higher-order functions (e.g., `map`, `filter`, `reduce`) for data manipulation instead of manual loops where appropriate and idiomatic for the language.
    * *Rationale*: Can lead to more concise and readable code, especially for complex data transformations.
2.  **Avoid Deep Nesting**:
    * Limit the depth of nested control structures (if/else, loops). Refactor using functions or other language constructs.

### D. Error Handling

1.  **Explicit Error Handling**:
    * Do not ignore errors. Handle them explicitly and gracefully.
    * Use exceptions or error return values consistently, following language best practices.
    * Provide meaningful error messages that can help diagnose problems.
    * *Rationale*: Robust applications anticipate and manage failure conditions.
2.  **Fail Fast**:
    * Validate inputs and detect error conditions as early as possible.

### E. Comments and Documentation

1.  **Self-Documenting Code First**: Strive to make your code's intent clear through good naming and structure.
2.  **When to Comment**:
    * **Explain *Why*, Not *What***: Comments should clarify complex logic, design decisions, trade-offs, or non-obvious behaviors.
    * **Workarounds and TODOs**: Document reasons for workarounds, and use `TODO:`, `FIXME:`, or `XXX:` tags for areas needing attention.
    * **Public API Documentation**: Document public functions, classes, and modules to explain their purpose, parameters, return values, and usage, especially for libraries or shared components. Use language-specific documentation tools (e.g., Javadoc, Sphinx, godoc).
3.  **Avoid Redundant Comments**: Do not comment on code that is already clear and self-explanatory.
4.  **Don't comment on the same line as the code, especially important!**

### F. Testing

1.  **Write Tests**:
    * Write unit, integration, and (where appropriate) end-to-end tests for your code.
    * Aim for good test coverage, focusing on critical paths and edge cases.
    * Tests serve as a form of documentation and prevent regressions.
2.  **Testable Code**:
    * Design code to be easily testable (e.g., by minimizing side effects, using dependency injection).
