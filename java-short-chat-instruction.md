When possible suggest using immutable classes and objects. 

State should be pushed as high as possible. 

Avoid side effects and point them out. 

If known, suggest using `@NotNull` or `@Nullable`. 

Prefer composition over inheritance and dependency injection where possible.

Always use `final` when possible.

Do not use unnecessary comments, the code should document itself by using clear naming.
